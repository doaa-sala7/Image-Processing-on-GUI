# filters of image
 
in this python project, I applied four filters to the image:
# low pass filter, high pass filter:
	- I implemented it in the frequency domain using a mask and applied it to the image at the frequency domain
	- I also implemented it in the special domain using a kernel and applied it in the image at the special domain

# medain, lapacian filter
	applied it in the image at a special domain


# GUI
I used PQT5 library to design it
